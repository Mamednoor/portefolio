                <h1>I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.</h1>
<p>Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. No children have ever meddled with the Republican Party and lived to tell about it.</p>
<p>I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. I was saying "Boo-urns. <strong>" Me fail English?</strong> <em> That's unpossible.</em> I was saying "Boo-urns.</p>
<h2>Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?</h2>
<p>Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman! I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</li><li>"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</li><li>The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity…</li>
</ol>

<h3>They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.</h3>
<p>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>

<li>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.</li><li>Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</li><li>I'll be back. You can't keep the Democrats out of the White House forever, and when they get in, I'm back on the streets, with all my criminal buddies.</li>
</ul>

<p>Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! I don't like being outdoors, Smithers. For one thing, there's too many fat children. Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.</p>
<p>Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Shoplifting is a victimless crime. Like punching someone in the dark. Inflammable means flammable? What a country.</p>
<p>Ahoy hoy? When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</p>
<p>And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. Your guilty consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!</p>
<p>I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. Last night's "Itchy and Scratchy Show" was, without a doubt, the worst episode *ever.* Rest assured, I was on the Internet within minutes, registering my disgust throughout the world.</p>
<p>He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Oh, I'm in no condition to drive. Wait a minute. I don't have to listen to myself. I'm drunk.</p>
<p>Homer no function beer well without. You don't win friends with salad. "Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.</p>
<p>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true!</p>
<p>Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway.</p>
<p>Old people don't need companionship. They need to be isolated and studied so it can be determined what nutrients they have that might be extracted for our personal use. I stand by my racial slur. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot.</p>
<p>Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Uh, no, they're saying "Boo-urns, Boo-urns."</p>
