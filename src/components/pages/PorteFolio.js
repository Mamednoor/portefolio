<p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
<p>Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. <strong> Partially, but it also obeys your commands.</strong> <em> The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</em> The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.</p>

<p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</p>

<li>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything.

Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.</li><li>I'm trying not to, kid.</li>

<h3>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</h3>
<p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
<ul>
<li>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</li><li>What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.</li><li>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ye-ha! I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.</p>
<p>A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. What?! I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me.</p>
<p>Red Five standing by. Ye-ha! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. What?! Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.</p>
<p>Don't underestimate the Force. I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Partially, but it also obeys your commands. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
<p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here. I'm trying not to, kid. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
<p>He is here. Don't underestimate the Force. Partially, but it also obeys your commands. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!</p>

<p>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
<p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this?</p>
<p>Red Five standing by. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.</p>
<p>The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. He is here. I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.</p>
