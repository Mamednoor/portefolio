                    <h1>Why yes! Thanks for noticing.</h1>
                <p>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</p>
                <p>Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. 
                    <strong> These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable.</strong> 
                    <em> I'll rest easier not knowing where they are.</em> 
                    Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</p>
                <h2>Yeah, and if you were the pope they'd be all, "Straighten your pope hat." And "Put on your good vestments."</h2>
                <p>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. No argument here. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! Soothe us with sweet lies.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!</li>
                    <li>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial?</li>
                    <li>It must be wonderful.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</h3>
                <p>Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel ways about stuff! Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? Guess again.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</li>
                    <li>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</li>
                    <li>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Do a flip! Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop.</p>
                <p>Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Can I use the gun? It must be wonderful. No argument here. Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</p>
                <p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
                <p>Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head." Shinier than yours, meatbag. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!</p>
                <p>I'll get my kit! Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Soothe us with sweet lies. Say what?</p>
                <p>Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. You know, I was God once.</p>
                <p>No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! When will that be? I'm sure those windmills will keep them cool. Shut up and get to the point! Of all the friends I've had… you're the first.</p>
                <p>Now what? And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Maybe I love you so much I love you no matter who you are pretending to be.</p>
                <p>Why did you bring us here? As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead. Also Zoidberg. Shut up and take my money! Alright, let's mafia things up a bit. Joey, burn down the ship. Clamps, burn down the crew.</p>
                <p>Kids don't turn rotten just from watching TV. There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! Bite my shiny metal ass. Ask her how her day was. We're rescuing ya.</p>
                <p>We're rescuing ya. We're rescuing ya. Daylight and everything. Now what? But, like most politicians, he promised more than he could deliver.</p>
